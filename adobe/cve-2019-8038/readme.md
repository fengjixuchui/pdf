More details will public after my final exam on my [blog](https://redogwu.github.io/).

This is a UAF vulerability. The exploit code could poc a `calc.exe` after disable the ASLR.

>   If u want to bypass ASLR, the information leak bug is needed. You need to leak the `AcroForm.api` base address.

-   Step 00: disable sandbox

-   Step 01: disable ASLR

In my local machine, when I disable the ASLR. The `AcroForm.api's` base address is `0x20800000`. You could edit it in the exploit code.

## To do list

-   Need to find a information leak bug to bypass the ASLR.
-   Need to bypass the sandbox, I will use [cve-2019-17236]().
    -   Achived the exploit code for LPE, need more work to know how to use it bypass sandbox.
-   Need to make it more stable.
-   Need to exploit it on windows 10.
-   Need to understand, If it is the first time see the related code. How can I build the poc code.
